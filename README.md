### meteor-to-read
This is a basic Meteor app to create a list of books to-read. Simple, easy and out of the box.

Based on meteor.com tutorials. This first version is just a draft using blaze. A new version with React is on its way.

### Installation
Just go to the application directory, run this command and start playing :)

```
meteor
```
